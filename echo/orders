#you can set environment variables here that will be included with your service
#remember, this is just a shellscript that runs 'before' your service starts

#this is a very important variable, this is the port your service will run at
#inside the container, which is then used by starphleet's proxy to route traffic
#from http://<shipname>/<path>
#in this case, this order for a service is at /echo, so
#http://<shipname>/echo
#reaches this service
export PORT=3000

#this is an autodeployed service, starphleet will watch this git repository
#and if it sees and changes to a rolling, no-interruption deployment
autodeploy https://github.com/wballard/echo.git
